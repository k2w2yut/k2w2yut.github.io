Let's use Copilot Agent to automate a full refresh of my Jekyll blog! Here’s a summary of what Copilot helped me accomplish:

## 1. Upgraded Jekyll and Dependencies
- Detected that my Ruby version was outdated and guided me to upgrade to Ruby 3.4.1.
- Updated all gems and dependencies using Bundler.
- Resolved compatibility issues and ensured a clean install.

## 2. Favicon Setup
- Explained where to place the favicon file and what size is best (32x32 px).
- Ensured the favicon was referenced in my site’s layout for browser support.

## 3. Build & Serve
- Built the site to verify everything worked after the upgrade.
- Served the site locally for preview at `localhost:3002`.

## 4. Committed & Pushed Changes
- Staged, committed, and pushed all changes to my GitHub repository.

Using Copilot made the process fast, smooth, and error-free.  
It sped up tasks that needed to be done.

This post was also pre-written by the agent.
