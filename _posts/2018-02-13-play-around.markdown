1. Try adding jekyll/swiss theme
    - just install and added theme to \_config.yl is not enough.
    - requires hard copy of theme folder
    - seems _Gem.ed_theme_ is not working?
    - Github authentication missing
      - solved by adding github: [metadata] in \_config.yml https://github.com/github/pages-gem/issues/399
